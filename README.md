# Find Associative Words v2

A *Family Feud-like* game which now supports real-time connection to have a screen and a remote device to control the game without typing the words! [Checkout the public version here](https://associative-words.netlify.app/). For now, this game can't be publicly shared since it is currently a **self-hosted** game, but in the future, I might add ability to create accounts, quizzes and playing them in your classroom, activity or somewhere else.

> This branch will remain without instructions on how to setup since the project is still in development and I don't have time to optimize, refactor and publicize it.
